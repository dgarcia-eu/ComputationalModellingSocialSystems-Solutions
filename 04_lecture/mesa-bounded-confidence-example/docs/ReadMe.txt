The model with enough details and pseudocode is described in the manuscript currently under review by JASSS.

Giude to run the model:
The model is coded in Python, using 'mesa' pachage.

The main.py file contains parameters to be set. The default values are those used in the manuscript under review. After running the model, output files are generated, which are input files for generate_diagrams to generate diagrams. The folder 'Last_Run' is defined to contain the input files and output diagrams of generate_dagram main file.

The model results and related diagrams are also uploaded.


Enjoy modelling
