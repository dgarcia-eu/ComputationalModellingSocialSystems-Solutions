    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The Schelling (1971) segregation model is a classic of agent-based modeling, demonstrating how agents following simple rules lead to the emergence of qualitatively different macro-level outcomes. Agents are randomly placed on a grid. There are two types of agents, one constituting the majority and the other the minority. All agents want a certain number (generally, 3) of their 8 surrounding neighbors to be of the same type in order for them to be happy. Unhappy agents will move to a more happier grid space (if available). While individual agents do not have a preference for a segregated outcome (e.g. they would be happy with 3 similar neighbors and 5 different ones), the aggregate outcome is nevertheless heavily segregated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sample Model Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial model is a very simple simulated agent segregation. The rules of our tutorial model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There are some number of agents.\n",
    "2. All agents begin as randomly placed on a grid.\n",
    "3. At every step of the model, an agent considers his surrounding neighbors to be of the same type in order for them to be happy.\n",
    "4. If an agent is unhappy, it moves the the unoccupied cell with maximal happines (if such happines is at least equal to the one at the current location); otherwise, an agent doesn't move\n",
    "5. If \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its simplicity, this model yields results that are often unexpected to those not familiar with it. For our purposes, it also easily demonstrates Mesa’s core features.\n",

    "## Setting up the model\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin writing the model code, we start with two core classes: one for\n",
    "the overall model, the other for the agents. The model class holds the\n",
    "model-level attributes, manages the agents, and generally handles the\n",
    "global level of our model. Each instantiation of the model class will be\n",
    "a specific model run. Each model will contain multiple agents, all of\n",
    "which are instantiations of the agent class. Both the model and agent\n",
    "classes are child classes of Mesa’s generic ``Model`` and ``Agent``\n",
    "classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each agent has only two variablea: its 2D position on the grid (x , y), and its type [0, 1].\n",
    "\n",
    "(Each agent will also have a unique identifier (i.e., a position), stored in\n",
    "the ``pos`` variable. Giving each agent a unique id is a good\n",
    "practice when doing agent-based modeling.)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of model-level parameters: \n",
    "\n",
    "- height and width of the grid\n",
    "- density of grid population to define how many agents and empty cells the model contains\n",
    "- minority proportion to define proportion of two types of agents on the grid\n",
    "- homophily treshold to which the agent is happy with its neighbourhood\n",
    "        \n",
    "When a new model is started, we want it to populate the grid itself with the defined number of agents segregated on the given proportion between two groups.\n",
