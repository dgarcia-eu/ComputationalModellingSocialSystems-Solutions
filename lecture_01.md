*(Please install Jupyter Notebook before the tutorial sessions takes place, where we can provide help with the installation if something goes wrong.)* The easiest way is using the [Anaconda](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) distribution, since it is well supported and maintained.

In case you have trouble following the given Anaconda installation tutorial or you get errors along the way, please consult the links in the Appendix with additional explanation.

### 1. Python crash course

This course has been adapted from lecture on "Daten Lesen Lernen" [GitHub](https://github.com/Daten-Lesen-Lernen/daten-lesen-lernen-lecture)

The Python crash course is aimed at teaching programming basics in Python as well as the usage of libraries and handling of different data types. This part of the course is very brief and only introduces concepts that will be strictly necessary in later parts of the course. 

The content of the tutorials is as follows:

1.1. [Übung 00](https://github.com/dgarcia-eu/ComputationalModellingSocialSystems-Solutions/tree/master/01_basics/python_introduction/00_uebung): Introduction to working with Jupyter Notebooks
1.2. [Übung 01](https://github.com/dgarcia-eu/ComputationalModellingSocialSystems-Solutions/tree/master/01_basics/python_introduction/01_uebung): Using Python as calculator
1.3. [Übung 02](https://github.com/dgarcia-eu/ComputationalModellingSocialSystems-Solutions/tree/master/01_basics/python_introduction/02_uebung): Lists, loops and tables
1.4. [Übung 03](https://github.com/dgarcia-eu/ComputationalModellingSocialSystems-Solutions/tree/master/01_basics/python_introduction/03_uebung): Logic, conditionals and filters
1.5. [Übung 04](https://github.com/dgarcia-eu/ComputationalModellingSocialSystems-Solutions/tree/master/01_basics/python_introduction/04_uebung): Functions, images and text

The data sets needed to complete the tutorials can be found in the folder [data](https://github.com/dgarcia-eu/ComputationalModellingSocialSystems-Solutions/tree/master/01_basics/python_introduction/data).

### 2. Pandas crash course

In this tutorial, we will walk through functionality of Pandas library, neccesary for data transformation and data visualization.

The content of the tutorials is as follows:

2.1. [Pandas data transformation tutorial](https://github.com/dgarcia-eu/ComputationalModellingSocialSystems-Solutions/blob/master/01_basics/pandas_introduction/pandas_introductory_tutorial_data.ipynb): Using Pandas Series object for data transformation

The data sets needed to complete the tutorials can be found in the folder [data](https://github.com/dgarcia-eu/ComputationalModellingSocialSystems-Solutions/tree/master/01_basics/python_introduction/data).


### 3. Mesa crash course

- Readings: ([Masad & Kazil, 2015](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jacqueline-Kazil/publication/328774079_Mesa_An_Agent-Based_Modeling_Framework/links/5cc7632192851c8d220e5897/Mesa-An-Agent-Based-Modeling-Framework.pdf))**Note that the code in the research paper might be depricated, so use the tutorial code for reference**

This tutorial has been adapted from the Mesa package introductory tutorial [GitHub](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/blob/main/docs/tutorials/intro_tutorial.rst). It has been purposefully simplified for the context of this course.

In this tutorial, we will walk through creating a simple model and progressively add functionality which will illustrate Mesa’s core features.

The content of the tutorials is as follows:

3.1. [Mesa setup](https://github.com/dgarcia-eu/ComputationalModellingSocialSystems-Solutions/blob/master/01_basics/mesa_introduction/mesa_setup_tutorial.ipynb): Introduction to setup Mesa package
3.2. [Mesa model tutorial](https://github.com/dgarcia-eu/ComputationalModellingSocialSystems-Solutions/blob/master/01_basics/mesa_introduction/mesa_introductory_tutorial_complete.ipynb): Using Mesa simple model creation
